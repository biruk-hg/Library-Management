# Library-Management
The Library Management System is a Java-based project aimed at facilitating efficient management of a library's resources, including books, borrowers, librarians, and borrowing transactions.
The FileReader Java class serves as a utility for reading data from text files related to a library management system. It supports the extraction of information about books, borrowers, librarians, and borrowing transactions from separate files, such as 'books.txt', 'borrowers.txt', 'librarians.txt', and 'borrows.txt'.
The project employs the FileReader class to parse data from external text files, such as 'books.txt', 'borrowers.txt', 'librarians.txt', and 'borrows.txt'. To utilize the system, users can run the Java program and ensure that the specified text files are correctly formatted with relevant information. The main class, LibraryManagement, showcases the functionality by reading and printing details of books, borrowers, librarians, and borrowing transactions.
